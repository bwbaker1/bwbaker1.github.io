Brad Baker

👋  Heyyo, I'm Brad!

💻  I'm a scientist.

🛠️  I'm currently working with the [IMPACT](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/) team under [NASA's ESDS program](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds).
At IMPACT, I work with various Earth Science 🌎 data, products and algorithms.

🎨  When I'm not working, I like running.
